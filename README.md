# webProject-LJ

This is my personal web project made for the Web Programming class in 2016/2017/1.

Project vision
	The project’s goal is to develop a board-game-like, minimalistic, online RTS (Real Time Strategy) game where 4 players compete with each other. The winner will be the one who aquired the most points in the given time.
	First players have to registrate providing email address, username and password through the games website. The registration must verified through an activation email.
	After the email validation users can login to the application on the website. Here players can launch a new game or view previous games  merged statistics. 
	With starting a new game the player automatically enters to the matchmaking queue. From here the game will start as soon as there are enough players and everyone of them is connected to the server.
	Finally the game begin and after the given time period the participants will get ranked by their earned points. The end game screen will also contain the actual game statistics.
